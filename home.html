    THE MOUSE 🐀
    </h1>
    <p>Does everyone use the mouse the same way?</p>
    <p> what even IS the MOUSE? 🐭</p>

    <div p class="description">
      The computer mouse is an instrument that enables users 
      to interact with the elements on their computer screen 🖥. 
      <br/>Without it, the user would not be able to maximize the full 
      capabilities of a computer.<br/> Potential substitutes of the computer 
      mouse, such as a trackpad or a touch screen, <br/>are arguably less 
      efficient compared to a computer mouse and don’t possess as much 
      functionality.

    <p>To find out more, I interviewed some people...</p>

        The mouse he has now is his favorite because it has two convenient, 
        rebindable buttons <br/> that he has binded to copy and paste.  
      </li>
      <li>
        He has never had a moment when his mouse failed to meet his expectations, which
        may <br/>be an indication that his mouse already serves him faultlessly
      </li>
      <li>
        He doesn't care what his mouse does as long as it has side buttons.
      </li>
      <li>
        If he had to change one thing, he wouldn't mind having more side buttons.

        His current mouse is the one he likes the most. It has 6 rebindable buttons <br/>
        in addition to the basic 3. The grip fits his hand really well  
      </li>
      <li>
        one of his old mice used to really infuriate him because the cursor didn't <br/>
        track his movements accurately so it didn't feel intuitive using it
      </li>
      <li>
        His current mouse has many extra features. For example, the scroll button can be <br/>
        tilted left to right for side scrolling
      </li>
      <li>
        He wishes his mouse could be convertible between wired and unwired

      <li>
        Her current mouse is her favorite because it's wired; it doesn't need charging and she has<br/>
         a history of losing USB recievers  
      </li>
      <li>
        For her previous mice, she became increasingly more frustrated everytime she lost the USB reciever <br/>
        for her unwired mice (5x). She used to buy the cheapest USB receiver mouse at Target before finally <br/>
        switching to her current wired one.
      </li>
      <li>
        She likes how simple her mouse is; she owns THE basic mouse.
      </li>
      <li>
        Would like a bluetooth mouse because it means no wire AND nothing to lose.

    <p>Great! Now that we're done with interviews, let's draw up some personas 🖍</p>
    <h2>
      THE PERSONAS
    </h2>
    <h3> Persona #1: Casual Clicker Casey ☕️💻 <br/>
    Casual Clicker Casey is the kind of person who only uses her mouse for convenience, <br/>
    and doesn't use it when it becomes inconvenient. Sometimes the trackpad on her laptop <br/>
    gets too annoying to deal with so she pulls out her trusty bluetooth mouse to get things <br/>
    going a little faster. When it comes to a computer mouse, the simpler the better. <br/> 
    Casual Clicker Casey represents the practical mouse users who just want a mouse for their <br/>
    portable laptop. </h3>

    <h3>Persona #2: Greedy Gamer Gary 🤑🎮 <br/>
    Greedy Gamer Gary represents the kind of users who are looking for a high-tech <br/>
    mouse to go with their high-tech computer set up. These users don't intend to use <br/>
    their mice with a laptop; they use their mice with a desktop monitor run by <br/>
    their powerful computers. The extra buttons help them maximize efficiency <br/>
    and the accurate, lag-free, specs of their mice are especially curated for their gaming needs.</h3>

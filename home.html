    THE MOUSE 🐀

  <p>Does everyone use the mouse the same way?</p>

  <div p class="description">
    The computer mouse is an instrument that enables users
    to interact with the elements on their computer screen 🖥.
    <br />Without it, the user would not be able to maximize the full
    capabilities of a computer.<br /> Potential substitutes of the computer
    mouse, such as a trackpad or a touch screen, <br />are arguably less
    efficient compared to a computer mouse and don’t possess as much
    functionality.

  <p>To find out more, I interviewed some people...</p>

      The mouse he has now is his favorite because it has two convenient,
      rebindable buttons <br /> that he has binded to copy and paste.
    </li>
    <li>
      He has never had a moment when his mouse failed to meet his expectations, which
      may <br />be an indication that his mouse already serves him faultlessly
    </li>
    <li>
      He doesn't care what his mouse does as long as it has side buttons.
    </li>
    <li>
      If he had to change one thing, he wouldn't mind having more side buttons.

      His current mouse is the one he likes the most. It has 6 rebindable buttons <br />
      in addition to the basic 3. The grip fits his hand really well
    </li>
    <li>
      one of his old mice used to really infuriate him because the cursor didn't <br />
      track his movements accurately so it didn't feel intuitive using it
    </li>
    <li>
      His current mouse has many extra features. For example, the scroll button can be <br />
      tilted left to right for side scrolling
    </li>
    <li>
      He wishes his mouse could be convertible between wired and unwired

    <li>
      Her current mouse is her favorite because it's wired; it doesn't need charging and she has<br />
      a history of losing USB recievers
    </li>
    <li>
      For her previous mice, she became increasingly more frustrated everytime she lost the USB reciever <br />
      for her unwired mice (5x). She used to buy the cheapest USB receiver mouse at Target before finally <br />
      switching to her current wired one.
    </li>
    <li>
      She likes how simple her mouse is; she owns THE basic mouse.
    </li>
    <li>
      Would like a bluetooth mouse because it means no wire AND nothing to lose.

  <p>Great! Now that we're done with interviews, let's draw up some personas 🖍</p>
  <h2>
    THE PERSONAS
  </h2>
  <h3> Persona #1: Casual Clicker Casey ☕️💻 <br />
    Casual Clicker Casey is the kind of person who only uses her mouse for convenience, <br />
    and doesn't use it when it becomes inconvenient. Sometimes the trackpad on her laptop <br />
    gets too annoying to deal with so she pulls out her trusty bluetooth mouse to get things <br />
    going a little faster. When it comes to a computer mouse, the simpler the better. <br />
    Casual Clicker Casey represents the practical mouse users who just want a mouse for their <br />
    portable laptop. </h3>

  <h3>Persona #2: Greedy Gamer Gary 🤑🎮 <br />
    Greedy Gamer Gary represents the kind of users who are looking for a high-tech <br />
    mouse to go with their high-tech computer set up. These users don't intend to use <br />
    their mice with a laptop; they use their mice with a desktop monitor run by <br />
    their powerful computers. The extra buttons help them maximize efficiency <br />
    and the accurate, lag-free, specs of their mice are especially curated for their gaming needs.</h3>
